# Focus With Me - Bug Tracking

This document tracks known bugs, issues, and fixes applied to the Focus With Me application.

## Fixed Issues

### Import Errors in App.tsx (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
Several imports in App.tsx were referencing non-existent modules, causing TypeScript errors:
- ControlButtons (`./components/controls/ControlButtons`)
- useInitialSettings (`./hooks/useInitialSettings`)
- useDarkMode (`./hooks/useDarkMode`)
- FullscreenButton (`./components/controls/FullscreenButton`)
- SettingsButton (`./components/controls/SettingsButton`)

**Fix:**
Removed the unused imports from the file. These components/hooks were likely planned but not implemented yet, or were removed during refactoring without updating App.tsx.

### Missing Theme Property in FocusVibes.tsx (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
The DEFAULT_VIBES array in FocusVibes.tsx had incomplete Vibe objects. According to the TypeScript definition, the `theme` property is required but was missing from the vibe definitions.

**Fix:**
Added the required `theme` property to each vibe object in the DEFAULT_VIBES array, matching the interface definition.

### Unused Import in FocusVibes.tsx (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
The ChevronUpIcon was imported but never used in the FocusVibes component.

**Fix:**
Removed the unused import to clean up the code and eliminate the ESLint warning.

### Cluttered Control Icons (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
The control icons in the bottom right corner were cluttered and visually confusing, with improper spacing and alignment.

**Fix:**
- Added proper alignment and centering to the control buttons
- Improved spacing between stacked buttons
- Added margin to ensure consistent visual separation

### Non-functional Settings Panel (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
Clicking on the settings icon didn't properly open the settings panel or the panel couldn't be closed because the SettingsPanel component wasn't accepting a close function.

**Fix:**
1. Added a dedicated `closeSettings` function to App.tsx
2. Updated the Settings panel backdrop to use the close function instead of toggle
3. Updated SettingsPanel component to:
   - Accept an `onClose` prop with the appropriate TypeScript interface
   - Add a proper header with a close button
   - Improve the animation with a slide-in effect
   - Style the panel according to the CSS classes already defined

### Missing onClose Prop in TimerSettings.tsx (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
After updating the SettingsPanel component to require an `onClose` prop, the TimerSettings component (which re-exports SettingsPanel) was throwing a TypeScript error because it wasn't providing the required prop.

**Fix:**
Updated the TimerSettings component to provide a no-op (empty) function for the `onClose` prop to satisfy the TypeScript requirement, ensuring compatibility with the updated SettingsPanel interface.

### Cluttered Icons in Minimal Mode (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
The minimal mode implementation caused cluttered icons when vibes container was minimized, creating a confusing user interface with too many control buttons in close proximity.

**Fix:**
1. Removed the minimal mode concept completely
2. Enhanced the minimized state of the FocusVibes component:
   - Improved positioning and styling of the minimized button
   - Added a visual indicator when audio is playing
   - Added a tooltip showing the currently playing track
   - Ensured all transitions are smooth between states
3. Simplified the app layout to always show the timer and vibes section
4. Reduced the number of control buttons to only include the essential settings toggle
5. Adjusted z-index values to prevent overlapping controls

### Overlapping Vertical Icon Stack (Fixed on [Current Date])

**Problem:**
When the FocusVibes component was minimized, the vertically stacked control icons were too close together, causing visual overlap and making interaction difficult. The icons were also too small for comfortable touch interaction, especially on mobile devices.

**Fix:**
1. Increased vertical spacing between stacked controls (from gap-3 to gap-6)
2. Enlarged the control buttons (from p-3 to p-4 with larger icon sizes)
3. Enhanced visual distinction:
   - Added border highlights and improved background opacity
   - Made the playing indicator larger and more visible
   - Increased text size and padding in the track name indicator
4. Ensured proper position to avoid overlap with other UI elements:
   - Moved controls further from the edge of the screen
   - Increased spacing between app controls and vibes controls
   - Adjusted mobile-specific positioning
5. Removed unused imports in App.tsx to fix ESLint warnings

## Current Issues

### Type Checking Errors in FocusVibes.tsx

**Problem:**
TypeScript is reporting missing `theme` properties in the DEFAULT_VIBES array despite the properties appearing to be present in the code. This may indicate an issue with how TypeScript is parsing the file or a caching problem.

**Status:** Need to investigate - the required properties appear to be present in the code.

## Future Considerations

1. Review all imports across the application to ensure they are necessary and being used
2. Ensure all TypeScript interfaces are properly implemented
3. Address ESLint warnings systematically to improve code quality
4. Consider implementing missing components that were imported but don't exist (e.g., ControlButtons)
5. Review the relationship between TimerSettings and SettingsPanel components to determine if both are needed
